# fiddle-tunes
An archive of traditional Irish and Scottish tunes, in MusicXML format.

## How to contribute
Use a notation app like [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org) or similar.

![Muse Score](README_images/musescore.png)

Transcribe your tunes, and Export them to the appropriate folder as uncompressed `.musicxml` along with a `.png` file, and create a `README.md` if desired.

Folder structure is like this:

```
- jigs
  - Tune_Name
    Tune_Name.musicxml
    Tune_Name-1.png
    README.md
- reels
```

Then issue a pull request to get your updates merged.

(Note that when browsing the repository in GitHub, light mode is recommended so you can see the exported transparent PNGs.)
